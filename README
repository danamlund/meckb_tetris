tetris keyboard firmware
========================
A keyboard that is also a tetris game.

It works by outputting key-presses to make ascii-art in a regular text editor.
It reads key presses to rotate and move the bricks like a regular tetris game.

Example
=======

![tetris](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danamlund/meckb_tetris/master/tetris.gif)

Usage
=====
1) Open a default text editor
2) Click the tetris button (top left key on this keyboard)
3) Play tetris

It makes ascii-art using left, right, up, down, home, end, qwerty characters, and numbers.

Problems
========
Drawing ascii-art is too slow to make a plesent playing experience.
While drawing ascii-art, the keyboard does not record key-presses, so its pretty unresponsive.

Implement in other keyboards
============================
 - Copy-paste the files tetris_text.c and tetrix_text.h to your keyboard.
 - Add/update you keyboard/rules.mk to include 'SRC = tetris_text.c'
 - Copy-paste most of the code from tetris keymap.c to yours.
 - Set a key to trigger F(0).
